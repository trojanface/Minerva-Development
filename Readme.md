1. Open Minerva.exe
2. Enter information you wish to learn by using 'To Learn' menu option
3. Alternatively you can place a shortcut of 'Persistent Monitor' in your startup file. This unlocks the hotkey Alt-Shift-C which will autmatically add highlighted text into a txt document. NOTE: All information needs to be a single line only. You may have to edit the information within the 'To Learn' menu option to ensure it only takes up a single line.
3. Use the Quiz Builder to breakdwon the 'To Learn' notes into questions that will be added to your Quiz Lineup. Note: If the fact you are learning is quite complex you can use the 'Add' button to add multiple questions related to the note. This is recommended for large amounts of information.
4. Run the 'Quiz' menu option preferably daily or as often as you can to check in and see if you have any questions scheduled for today.
